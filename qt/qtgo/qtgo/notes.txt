TODO:
v 1. Use do_genmove for playing against the computer. Also look at other functions in the file for computing the score.
v 1.1 Make pass work.
v 1.2 Provide undo - seems to work.
1.3 Show move numbers
v 1.4 Highlight last move! Low quality but works.
1.5 Maybe show a moves tree with undo and sutff.

2. Give feedback that the computer is currently calculating and block interaction while computing.
    ? - introduced a timer to reject clicks; not very needed after introducing AIThread. There may still be situations when a wrong click could be performed.
    v - change background colour as a very easy fix
    v - added a new icon for the type of player
    - confirm button when stopping and other actions that might be triggered by mistake, especially on phone.

3. Save current game.
    v - introduced basic loading of a saved game
    v - load player types
    v - when the one to move was the computer we should ask the user to resume
    v - continuing does not work on Android
    v - push loaded settings from table to settings widget

3.1 Android UI
    v - remove top menu
      - immersive mode - fuck it for now, too difficult
    v - confirmation button
      - add player colour to the confirmation button
      - make the feedback circle more obvious (a large finger on a touchscreen); an intersection of lines is also a solution I saw in some programs
      - double tap
      - disable portrait layout
      - make sidebar hideable
      - triggering the AI menu during play may make the menu not fit on the screen.

4. Correct score computation.

5. Learn about Komi and and options.

6. AI should be selectable.

7. Play over ethernet.

8. Protect calls to GnuGo. Making multiple calls will crash it. Ex: press the compute score button while computing the next move.

9. Crash: match AI vs AI, press finish after very few moves.


How-to:
1. Omit a file from commit:
git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt
git commit -a -m "This is my commit messages"
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt


Bugs:
1. The compilation says: warning, failure to find engine/liberty.h
2. After finishing the game the current player type icon is wrong.
3. LG G3 fonts are too big, everything looks messy. Fixed player info, nothing about font size yet.
v 4. When finishing the game the current player might reported wrongly: close the program on computer's turn, reload, press finish instead of continuing.
5. With Sony Xperia the radio buttons don't show what's selected, altough they seem to work. Seems like a Qt bug, won't fix now.
6. At startup table size is not the one selected by buttons.
7. Not showing the last move when loading a saved game.
8. If the last move in a game was an undo, restoring the game will be wrong.
