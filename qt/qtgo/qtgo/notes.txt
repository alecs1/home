TODO:
v 1. Use do_genmove for playing against the computer. Also look at other functions in the file for computing the score.
v 1.1 Make pass work.
1.2 Provide undo
1.3 Show move numbers
v 1.4 Highlight last move! Low quality but works.

2. Give feedback that the computer is currently calculating and block interaction while computing.
    ? - introduced a timer to reject clicks; not very needed after introducing AIThread. There may still be situations when a wrong click could be performed.
    v - change background colour as a very easy fix

3. Save current game.
    v - introduced basic loading of a saved game
    - load player types
    v - when the one to move was the computer we should ask the user to resume
    v git - continuing does not work on Android

3.1 Android UI
    v - remove top menu
      - immersive mode - fuck it for now, too difficult
    v - confirmation button
      - add player colour to the confirmation button
      - make the feedback circle more obvious (a large finger on a touchscreen); an intersection of lines is also a solution I saw in some programs
      - double tap
      - disable portrait layout
      - make sidebar hideable
      - triggering the AI menu during play may make the menu not fit on the screen.

4. Correct score computation.

5. Learn about Komi and and options.

6. AI should be selectable.

7. Play over ethernet.

8. Protect calls to GnuGo. Making multiple calls will crash it. Ex: press the compute score button while computing the next move.

9. Crash: match AI vs AI, press finish after very few moves.


How-to:
1. Omit a file from commit:
git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt
git commit -a -m "This is my commit messages"
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt


Other bugs:
1. The compilation says: warning, failure to find engine/liberty.h
2. After finishing the game the current player type icon is wrong.
