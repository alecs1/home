TODO:
v 1. Use genmove for playing against the computer. Also look at other functions in the file for computing the score.
v 1.0 Make choosing the AI level work.
v 1.1 Make pass work.
v 1.2 Provide undo.
1.3 Show move numbers
v 1.4 Highlight last move! Low quality but works.
1.5 Maybe show a moves tree with undo and sutff.
v 1.6 Make hint work - works very very nicely

2. Give feedback that the computer is currently calculating and block interaction while computing.
    ? - introduced a timer to reject clicks; not very needed after introducing AIThread. There may still be situations when a wrong click could be performed.
    v - change background colour as a very easy fix
    v - added a new icon for the type of player
    v - confirm button when stopping and other actions that might be triggered by mistake, especially on phone.

3. Save current game.
    v - introduced basic loading of a saved game
    v - load player types
    v - when the one to move was the computer we should ask the user to resume
    v - continuing does not work on Android
    v - push loaded settings from table to settings widget

3.1 Android UI
    v - remove top menu
      - immersive mode - fuck it for now, too difficult
    v - confirmation button
      - confirmation button for pass and undo also
    v - add player colour to the confirmation button
      - make the feedback circle more obvious (a large finger on a touchscreen); an intersection of lines is also a solution I saw in some programs
      - double tap
    n - disable portrait layout; won't do
      - make sidebar hideable
      - triggering the AI menu during play may make the menu not fit on the screen.
      - write Save and Open game dialogs that are usable on Android

4. Correct score computation.

5. Learn about Komi and and options.
    - move the handicap button to the bottom, like semi statusbar.

v 6. AI should be selectable.

7. Play over ethernet.

v 8. Protect calls to GnuGo. Making multiple calls will crash it. Ex: press the compute score button while computing the next move.

9. Allow undo to restart a finished game.

10. Add sounds.


How-to:
1. Omit a file from commit:
git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt
git commit -a -m "This is my commit messages"
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt


Bugs:
1. The compilation says: warning, failure to find engine/liberty.h
2. After finishing the game the current player type icon is wrong.
v 3. LG G3 fonts are too big, everything looks messy. Fixed player info, nothing about font size yet.
v 4. When finishing the game the current player might reported wrongly: close the program on computer's turn, reload, press finish instead of continuing.
5. With Sony Xperia the radio buttons don't show what's selected, altough they seem to work. Seems like a Qt bug, won't fix now.
v 6. At startup table size is not the one selected by buttons.
v 7. Not showing the last move when loading a saved game.
8. If the last move in a game was an undo, restoring the game will be wrong.
9. Undoing won't correctly show the last move.
10. Crash when pressing finish in an AI vs AI game, because PlaceStone will continue to trigger AI moves.
v 11. Undo after pass undoes the last valid move, not the pass.
12. At the end of the game the AI stone animation does not stop.
13. Not differentiang well between two local human players.
v 14. After loading a game of size 9 and starting to play, GnuGo will actually assume table size of 19.


Crt:
1. Add handicap and komi, show estimates will default to false after each match.
2. For qtcurve install: libqt5x11extras5-dev, qtbase5-private-dev


Bugs to Qt Android:
1. dialog.setWindowState(Qt::WindowFullScreen); makes the window not fit the screen.
2. cannot correctly initialise QML window over the main software window.
3. hide() and then show() on QQuickWidget creates garbage on the screen.
4. Sony Xperia Z theme - radio buttons don't show the selected option.
5. Set stylesheed with alignment to QPushButton and it will duplicate the text.
