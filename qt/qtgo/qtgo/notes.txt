TODO:
v 1. Use do_genmove for playing against the computer. Also look at other functions in the file for computing the score.
v 1.1 Make pass work.
1.2 Provide undo
1.3 Show move numbers
1.4 Highlight last move!

2. Give feedback that the computer is currently calculating and block interaction while computing.
    ? - introduced a timer to reject clicks; not very needed after introducing AIThread. There may still be situations when a wrong click could be performed.
    v - change background colour as a very easy fix

3. Save current game.

3.1 Android UI
    v - remove top menu
      - immersive mode - fuck it for now, too difficult
    v - confirmation button
      - add player colour to the confirmation button
      - make the feedback circle more obvious (a large finger on a touchscreen); an intersection of lines is also a solution I saw in some programs
      - double tap
      - disable portrait layout
      - make sidebar hideable
      - triggering the AI menu during play may make the menu not fit on the screen.

4. Correct score computation.

5. Learn about Komi and and options.

6. AI should be selectable.

7. Play over ethernet.

8. Protect calls to GnuGo. Making multiple calls will crash it. Ex: press the compute score button while computing the next move.

9. Crash: match AI vs AI, press finish after very few moves.


How-to:
1. Omit a file from commit:
git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt
git commit -a -m "MOBILE-1234: changed a bunch of files but excluded that one I'm saving for later."
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt
