"also if you had many overloads combinations of const/non-const reference, you would have to provide overloads for all." - don't understand why we'd need const/non-const reference combinations. 
Relevant code in perfect-forwarding.cpp
    std::shared_ptr<Resource> sp0 = factory<Resource>(ResArg("R0"));
    printf("temporary - done\n\n");


    //return by value
    std::shared_ptr<Resource> sp1 = factory<Resource>(DefaultResArg());
    printf("return by value function - done\n\n");

    //lvalue
    ResArg rA2("R2");
    std::shared_ptr<Resource> sp2 = factory<Resource>(rA2); //one ResArg copy constructor here
    printf("lvalue - done\n\n");
